# Description

This is one of my very first trials in the vast field of front-end design. I simply designed a dynamic and responsive login page, as one of the most practical and common web pages within the World Wide Web. This design aligns intimately with the latest version of minimalistic *Material Design 3* (*Material You*) developed by Google. Although the designed webpage lacks functionality at the current time, it demonstrates a farsighted vision and promising future for the upcoming front-end projects, as the author's first serious experience in this area.
To fully observe and test the login page, download the entire repository (to include dependencies) and open up the _Login.html_ file using a web browser on your PC.
